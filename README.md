# Store App overview: 
Sign in to Store App with your Gmail account. In this application, you can browse products from different categories such as clothing, shoes, electronics, furniture, and more. Each product includes images, detailed information, and an option to add it to your cart.
Inside the cart, you can modify the quantity of each product or remove it if you no longer wish to purchase it.

To begin this project, the documentation of the API provided by Platzi, “Platzi Fake Store API”, was reviewed, where the information about the different endpoints needed to make requests was obtained.
Subsequently, the Stitch tool from Google was used to design the application’s interface. Once the screens were defined, the design was exported to Figma to review details such as element sizes, images, paddings, and other visual aspects.
